**Screen Creation Assistant**
- New superuser **Screen Creation Assistant** (sidebar, above Monitoring) — a guided wizard that turns
  picked tables into a live screen + dialog + menu in one pass: tables & joins, columns → tabs,
  dictionary review, and menu placement.
- **Catalog presets** — operator-managed table presets (`config/presets/`), browsable and searchable;
  selecting one pre-wires the joins. Ships a JD Edwards Address Book catalog.

**Dictionary**
- Shared scan table between the Dictionary editor and the assistant: existing entries are detected and
  only missing ones are proposed, with Format/Rule dropdowns, rule value, **UDC lookup params**, and
  default.

**Config history**
- **Upgrade history** — Settings → History → Upgrades records each application version change.
- **Release notes** — this view.

## 7.0.26 — 2026-06-01

- Screen + dependency **bundle versioning** (Phase 2): every screen save snapshots its dependency
  closure; restore reverts the screen *with* its queries/lookups/dictionary entries.
- **Retention purge** job for config-version snapshots; per-version and per-file delete.
- Read-only screen mode; move a field between dialog tabs from the inspector.
